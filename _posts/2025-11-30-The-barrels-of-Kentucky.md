Vast farm lands filled with grains to be harvested in terms of weeks. The old factory has been shut down. We built a new behemoth of a factory down south of the farm, which employs almost twice as many workers now, and produces almost twice as much spirit as the old factory. It doesn’t feel the same anymore, the sun shines but there’s no life, there’s business but there’s no soul around. None familiar at least. 

It's a rather sunny Saturday morning. It feels a little too late to be in bed. I’ve been like this for two hours now—groggy eyes and an aching body. I can’t seem to get up. Woolly snuggles into me on the bed; he seems to be resting fine, even with the sun blasting his white fur with heat. It’s been two weeks since father’s passing. I miss hearing the tractors running wild early in the morning. The smell of roasted coffee and fresh cream. Dad was always on his feet, shuffling between his hobbies and the estate.
